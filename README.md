# Simple-IoT-Implementing-Website
This small project is trying to implement IoT concept on microwaves. This project isn't finished yet, since the progress is still the UI using website. So, in this project, microwave owners are expected to control the microwave from web/application, not from buttons on the microwave itself.
In this project, I use HTML and CSS for UI and JavaScript to control the data flow from UI to the microwave system. But I haven't finished yet to connect the UI with the microwave itself.
